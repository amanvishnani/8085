# 8085 Simulator

8085 Microprocessor is an elementary processor and can be programmed with Arithmetic and Logical Program (ALP) using its predefined instruction set. The idea is to build an 8085 simulator, designed (using Swing & AWT components) and developed in java which can mimic the way 8085 executes instructions. This software will gives user a real life experience and absolve them from the old fashioned training kits and confusing op codes. Students can practice on this software hassle free with clean and neat GUI. The software aims to provide user with status of accumulator (A), Registers (B, C, D, E, H, and L), Flags, Instruction Pointer, Program Counter and Stack Pointer. The software will feature a Text Area available to user for writing program and ability to execute one instruction at a time. More features will be added in future depending on the ease of programmer.
